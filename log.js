/*Git Log - Complete Theory

 What is Git Log?Git log is a Git command that displays the commit history of a repository. It shows a chronological list of all commits made to the project, providing a complete audit trail of changes over time.Think of it as a detailed journal or timeline that records every snapshot (commit) of your project's development history.

 Why Use Git Log?

1. Track Project History

See the complete evolution of your codebase
Understand how the project grew from start to current state
View the sequence of features and fixes added over time

2. Debugging and Troubleshooting

Find when a bug was introduced
Identify which commit broke functionality
Trace back to a working state
Understand the context of problematic changes

3. Code Review and Audit

Review what changes were made and why
See who made specific changes (accountability)
Understand the reasoning behind decisions through commit messages
Audit compliance and code quality

4. Collaboration and Communication

Understand what team members are working on
See the progress of features and tasks
Coordinate work and avoid conflicts
Learn from others' implementations

5. Project Management

Track milestone completion
Monitor development velocity
Generate release notes
Document feature additions and bug fixes

6. Learning and Documentation

Learn how specific features were implemented
Understand design decisions
Study code evolution patterns
Create documentation based on actual development history

7. Recovery and Rollback

Find specific commits to revert to
Identify stable points in development
Recover lost work by finding old commits
Cherry-pick specific changes

8. Code Archaeology

Investigate why code exists in its current form
Understand legacy code decisions
Find original implementations
Discover forgotten features or approaches

 What Information Does Git Log Provide?Core Information:
Commit Hash (SHA)

Unique identifier for each commit
Used to reference specific commits
Example: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0...



Author Information

Name of the person who made the commit
Email address
Example: John Doe <john@example.com>



Date and Time

When the commit was created
Timezone information
Example: Mon Jan 13 14:30:00 2026 +0530



Commit Message

Description of what changed
Why the change was made
Example: "Fixed login bug that prevented users from signing in"



Branch Information

Which branch the commit belongs to
Branch merge points
HEAD position (current location)


Extended Information (with flags):
File Changes Statistics

Which files were modified
Number of lines added/removed
Number of files changed



Actual Code Differences (Diff)

Line-by-line changes
What was added (green)
What was removed (red)



Graph Structure

Visual representation of branches
Merge points
Branch relationships
