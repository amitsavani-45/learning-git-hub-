/*What is git merge?

git merge is a Git command used to combine changes from one branch into another branch.

It helps developers integrate work done in different branches (like feature branches) into the main branch (such as main or master).

🔹 Why Do We Use git merge?

In software development:

Different features are developed in separate branches.

After completing the feature, we need to add (integrate) it into the main project.

git merge allows us to combine those changes safely.

🔹 Basic Concept

Suppose you have:

main branch → Production-ready code

feature-login branch → Login feature development

When the login feature is completed, you merge it into main.

👉 Git takes the changes from feature-login and integrates them into main.
